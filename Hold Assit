# What happens to a multi-million dollar industry built on managing wait times when Apple makes waiting painless?

Yesterday, I called to reschedule my booking. After navigating the menu, I heard the familiar script: *‚ÄúYour call is very important to us and someone will be there shortly.‚Äù*  
Instead of enduring the robotic message, I tried Apple‚Äôs **Hold Assist**, which muted the music and notified me when the agent answered.  

For 50 years, enterprises have controlled what customers hear while waiting‚Äîmusic, ads, and scripted reassurances. With iOS 26, Apple shifted that control to the customer. What feels like a small design feature may have the potential to upend an industry built on waiting.

## The Billion Dollar Business of Waiting  

Waiting is not just an annoyance for customers‚Äîit‚Äôs a billion dollar business for enterprises.  

According to [Dimension Market Research](https://dimensionmarketresearch.com/report/virtual-queuing-system-market/), the global virtual queuing system market is worth **$657 million today** and is projected to reach **$1.27 billion by 2034**, enough to employ 20,000 contact center agents full-time.

## The Cost Paradox  

While Apple makes it easy for customers to escape the pain of waiting, it changes the cost equation for many enterprises.  

### What companies gain today  

Virtual hold and callback systems generate real, measurable ROI:  

- In healthcare, adding callback capability reduced abandonment rates from ~30% to just 1% in six months ([Keona Health](https://www.keonahealth.com/resources/missed-calls-healthcare-call-abandonment-roi)).  
- Callback adoption has been shown to boost first-contact resolution by 75% and cut wait times by nearly a third ([Teliqon](https://teliqon.io/blog/how-intelligent-callback-queues-reduce-wait-times)).  
- Forrester reports that callback systems can lower abandonment by up to 75% and reduce talk time by 25% ([Forrester](https://tei.forrester.com/go/Talkdesk/CXCloud/?lang=en-us)).  

### What changes when calls stay live  

Apple Hold Assist does not disconnect the call‚Äîit only silences the music. This alters the ROI math:  

- Companies still pay for every toll-free minute, but now they‚Äôre paying for **dead air**.  
- Branded on-hold messages, which once influenced behavior and reduced hang-ups, are silenced.  
- Vendors still get paid for content fewer people hear.  
- Enterprises can‚Äôt abandon callbacks or MOH, so they end up funding **both worlds**.

## But Wait, Doesn‚Äôt Android Already Do This?  

Yes. Android has offered similar features for years through apps and settings. The industry survived.  

So why might Apple be different?  

- iPhone users represent **57% of U.S. smartphones** ([StatCounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america)).  
- Apple features tend to become *default behavior overnight*, not optional settings.  
- When Apple normalizes something, industries often respond.  

Or maybe it won‚Äôt be different. Maybe the hold industry adapts again.

## The Big Question  

If Android‚Äôs hold features didn‚Äôt kill the industry, will Apple‚Äôs?  

- Maybe enterprises reinvent hold engagement.  
- Maybe they double down on callback systems.  
- Or maybe, when premium customers start ignoring hold experiences at scale, the economics finally break.  

The billion-dollar question isn‚Äôt whether Apple killed hold music.  
It‚Äôs whether this is the tipping point where enterprises finally ask:  

**‚ÄúWhy are we paying to talk to people who aren‚Äôt listening?‚Äù**
